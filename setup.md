## Setup Instructions

If this website is meant to be used as an in-person training, 
participants should already have access to a large-scale compute 
system, via: 

* training accounts
* previously created accounts or allocations

Participants should also have a computer which can connect to the 
internet, in order to log into the relevant resource via 
the network.  If special accommodations are needed to access the 
resource via the network (IP addresses, a virtual private 
network (VPN)), these should also be in place.  

If this website is meant as a reference, or self-paced course, 
readers need no special preparation with accounts, as one of the 
[episodes]() 
will show them how to apply for one.
