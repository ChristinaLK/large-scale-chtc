## On our system

To use CHTC's high throughput compute system, you will log in to 
one of our submit servers, using one of the following two hostnames: 

* `submit-3.chtc.wisc.edu`
* `submit-5.chtc.wisc.edu`

Your username and password will be your campus NetId and password, 
unless you are an off-campus collaborator and have been provided with 
a different username.  

> ## Firewalls
>
> Note that our submit servers have a firewall to stop off-campus 
> connections.  If you are not connected to a campus network, you
> will need to use the [campus VPN]() to make it appear that you 
> are on campus so you can connect to the submit servers.

{: .callout}

> ## Exercise
